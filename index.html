        <h2>What's TypeScript?</h2>
        <p>
          TypeScript offers all the same features as JavaScript with an
          additional feature: TypeScript's type system. What does this
          system do? In JavaScript variables are not explicitly defined and
          held to a certain type. TypeScript is able to take a value assigned
          to a variable and hold that variable to that type of value, while
          providing the option to explicitly define your variable types.

        <h3>How to Define a Type</h3>
          <p>
              While TypeScript is capable of dynamically setting types for primitive
              types and some design patterns, some patterns cannot be inferred automatically.
              To fix this, TypeScript supports an extension of JavaScript allowing
              you to tell TypeScript what the type should be. <br>
              The following snippet describes an explicity interface declaration:
          </p>
          <div class="code-ex">
            <p>
              interface Student {    <br>
              |  name: string;    <br>
              |  id: number;      <br>
          }
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            You can then force a JavaScript object to adhere to the interface's
            declaration by using the following syntax <span>: TypeName</span>
            after a variable declaration, which can be seen below:
          </p>
          <div class="code-ex">
            <p>
              const student: Student = { <br>
              | name: "Ratatouille",     <br>
              |  id: 0,                  <br>
              };
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you provide an object that doesn't follow your interface, TypeScript
            will give a warning.<br>
            The same principles apply to with declarations in regards to classes
          </p>

          <h3>Creating Types</h3>
          <p>
            TypeScript can allow you to create more complex types by merging
            simpler ones together. The two simplest ways to achieve this is with
            unions and generics.
